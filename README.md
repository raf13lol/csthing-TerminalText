# csthing-TerminalText

a c# thing where the terminal does like text and should work
 
i would write up all the tags but im reallllly fucking lazy

## some important tags i think

`<u>` - Underline<br>
`<i>` - Italic<br>
`<b>` - Bold

im really sorry about my lazyness

[just check a file for every single tag](./TerminalText/TerminalFancyTextParser.cs)
